    <h1>Div Tags</h1>
    <h2>Why are div tags used?</h2>
    <div>
        A div tag isn't too different from a p tag, except, there are a few major differences.
        <div>
            1. divs are nestable, meaning they can be the parent/child elements to other div tags.
            Whereas p tags would just pop out of each and this would cause problems.
        </div>
        <div>
            2. the spacing between block elements is different, theres less space
            <p style="border: red 1px solid;">p tags look like this</p>
            <div style="border: red 1px solid;">Whereas divs looks more like this</div>
        </div>
        
    </div>
