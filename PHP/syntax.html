    <h2>Opening up PHP</h2>
    <p>PHP-syntax must be opened with a &lt;?php and closed with a ?&gt;</p>
    <div class="code-container">
      <h3>Long-hand, but more accepted</h3>
      <blockquote class="code">
        &lt;?php<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// code in here<br />?>
      </blockquote>
    </div>
    <div class="code-container">
      <h3>Short-hand</h3>
      <blockquote class="code">
        &lt;?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// code in here<br />?>
      </blockquote>
    </div>
    <h2>echo & strings</h2>
    <p>
      Now that we know how to open our php tags, it's time to write our first
      bit of php code.
    </p>
    <p>
      In PHP, when we want to write anything in the server we can use the
      <b>echo</b> construct. This is not a function, even though it can be
      written as one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now because this is a string we had to wrap it in "quotation marks" this
      tell the server this is just text, don't do anything fancy with it.
    </p>
    <div class="code-container">
      <h3></h3>
      <blockquote class="code">
        &lt;?php<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;echo "Hello World";<br />?>
      </blockquote>
    </div>
    <p>
      One of the great features about PHP is you can put it anywhere in your
      HTML, and that'll be where it's placed.
    </p>
    <h2>Semicolons</h2>
    <p>When you I use them?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>After every single line</li>
      <li>After every single statement</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      JavaScript and jQuery are quite forgiving when it comes to Semicolons, but
      PHP is not. If you forget a single semicolon your code will not work.
