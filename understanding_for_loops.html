        // First, create an array of data for the loop to cycle through

        var nums=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];

        //Next, you'll need to create the conditionals for the loop running
        // 1. assign a variable that'll keep track of the amount of times it's run through the loop
        //    starting at 0
        // 2. then say how long you want the loop to run for,
        //    so i put, keep running for as long as the number of times 
        //    it has gone through the loop, are smaller than the amount of items in the array
        //    (Until it has gone through the array once)
        // 3. then say how many indexes you'd like to move up by, after every loop cycle
        //    (i++ is shorthand for i=i+1 i.e move up one index)

        //  Then you've just got to write what you want it to do for each item in the array
        //  Simple.
        
        for(let i = 0;i < nums.length;i++){
            if((nums[i]/2)%1 === 0){
                nums[i]=nums[i]*nums[i]
            }
        }
