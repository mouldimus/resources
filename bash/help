If you're ever stuck in the terminal emulator, and you're struggling to remember commands. 
This is for you.

apropos "what the command does"
This is quite litterally the google of your commands.
If you're ever like, "How do I do this again?", just type in a keyword after the apropos command, to list all commands with that keyword in they're description.

man "CommandName"
For when you're like, "What does this command do again?"
It'll print out a user manual on the command.

"CommandName" -h or "CommandName" --help
Most commands normally have a quick help option coded into them somewhere.
This'll just print out a quick how to guide for the command.
