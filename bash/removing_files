the command rm will delete the file specified
USE WITH CAUTION! this will permantly delete the file, no trash, no warning, it's gone

for example

rm index.html

would PERMANTLY remove the file "index.html" from my computer

the command rmdir, as you can imagine removes the specified directory

for example

rmdir no\ spaces

will PERMANTLY delete the folder "no spaces"

however, the terminal does not let you remove directories with files inside by default 

using the flag keys we can remove file directories and their contents on mass.
-for more info on flags see flags

for example 

rm -r folder-name

would delete the folder and all of its contents PERMANTLY
