root directory = the first parent directory on the computer
users directory = the "Users" directory
home directory = the first directory after the users directory. basically where most user files are like:
- documents
- images
- music
- video
- etc

using the terminal you need to be able to navigate through the directory
here are a couple of useful commands for that:
- pwd = Print Working Directory - i.e. display the current pathname of your directory - i.e. /users/mouldimus/documents/personal/
- cd = Change Directory - i.e move from one directory to the other
- ls = List - i.e list items in your current directory

here are some shortcuts to get to useful places:
- cd / - takes you to your root directory
- cd ~ - takes you to your home directory
- while typing use the "TAB" key to autofill 
- cd .. - will always take you UP one directory
