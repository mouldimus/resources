you can use the touch command to create empty files within a specified directory.
if none is specified it'll create however many you've written within the current directory
for example:

    touch ~/Documents/personal/coding/index.html style.css script.js

this would create 3 files within the "coding" directory

- index.html
- style.css
- script.js
  it would not matter what directory you were already in because we are stating that ~ which means home

side note: this command was orginally designed to change the date in which the selected file was edited.
but it turns out if there's no file there with that name the command would create an empty file with that name instead.

you can also make folder or <i>directories</i> using the mkdir
for example:

    mkdir web_dev

would create a folder in my current directory called web_dev

to specify that you are going to use a space in terminal you must use the \

so to create a directory called "no spaces" you'd write the line

    mkdir no\ spaces
