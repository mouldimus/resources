using the vscode command pallete i have installed a few commands specifically for vscode
i did this by searching "shell commands" and installing the code

Commands you should know:
1. code --help
This will display all the commands available with the vscode command by default.
2. code -r filename 
This will open the file in a new window
3. code -a directoryname
This will add the directory to your workspace
4.
