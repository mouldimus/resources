the command mv can move files from one directory to another
for example

mv 123.txt text_files

would move the file "123.text" to the directory text_files

however if there is already a file in that directory with the same the old one will be replaced without warning.

-n does the opposite of the default. it does NOT overwrite the file in the folder

to stop this you can use the -i flags to ask you to confirm before you still want to move the file if it'll overwrite the one already in the folder

. = your current directory
.. = your parent directory

You can also rename files/folders using the mv command too, by simply specifing the file/folder name you want to rename and renaming it

for example
mv 123.txt 1234.text

would change the file "123.txt" to "1234.txt"
