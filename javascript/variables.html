    <p>
      Make sure to check what the error in the console is, as it normally tells
      you where it thinks the problem has occured
    </p>
    <p>When declaring variables, make sure to declare the correct syntax.</p>
    <p>i.e. a semi-colon after every line.</p>
    <p>Use the "var" to create a variable.</p>
    <p>= after a variable name sets the default value of the variable.</p>
    <p>
      Anything that is classified as a string, something that has spaces in must
      be surrounded by ""
    </p>
    <p>
      Numbers can be stored in the variable without extra syntax, so long as
      they don't have spaces.
