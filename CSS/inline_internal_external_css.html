    <!-- This is an example of External CSS, 
    because rather than having it INTERNALLY on the html document, 
    I'm storing it seperately, which also means I can use the 
    same stylesheet for multiple html documents.
    This is best practice in most cases. -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

    This would be an example of Internal CSS,
     because it's being stored inside(internally) the html document.
    This would generally be used on a one page website, 
    as they wouldn't need to reference it on other sites.

    <!-- Inline CSS is where you style the html element individually.
    Used quite often on bits of code that need unique styling. -->
