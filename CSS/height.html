        Block elements can have a height asigned to them, However nothing can be put in the other part of the block element.<br>
        So it's essentially like asigning the rest of the height to margin.
    </div>
    <div>
        Inline-block elements are the best of both worlds. They can have a height asigned to them whilst still being flexible in positioning.
    </div>
    <div>
        Inline elements cannot have their heights changed.
